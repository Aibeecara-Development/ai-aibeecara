Let’s start with a simple question:
What do you usually do after you wake up?

Now let’s test your grammar a little:
Can you write a sentence using the **present simple tense** to describe your morning?

Great! Now, try to use an **adverb of frequency** (like *usually*, *often*, *sometimes*) in a new sentence.

I’ll review your sentences and help correct any grammar mistakes I see. Don’t worry, I’ll explain why and give you examples if needed!"""

        "message": """Hello! I'm excited to chat with you about **traveling** today! 

Let’s begin:
 Have you ever traveled to another country? If yes, where did you go?

Here’s a grammar challenge:
Can you describe your last trip using the **past simple tense**?

Next, try this:
Write a sentence using **past participle** (e.g., *I have eaten*, *I have been to*, etc.) to talk about a travel experience.

I’ll check your sentences and let you know if there are any small grammar mistakes—and how to fix them. """

    {
        "topic_name": "Work",
        "message": """Hi! Let’s talk about your job or future career plans. 

First question:
 What do you do for work? Or what would you like to do in the future?

Now let’s test your grammar:
Can you write a sentence using **modal verbs** (e.g., *can*, *should*, *must*) to talk about responsibilities at work?

Try another one:
Use the **future tense** (*will*, *going to*, etc.) to describe what you think your job will be like in 5 years.

I'll review your answers and give you some feedback to help improve your grammar. Feel free to ask questions too!"""

Let’s start:
What do you like to do in your free time?

Let’s add a grammar twist:
Can you describe your hobby using a **gerund**? (For example: *I enjoy painting*, *I like playing football*)

Next, try to use a **comparative sentence**:
Compare two hobbies you’ve tried. (e.g., *I think swimming is more relaxing than running*)

I’ll help you correct any mistakes and explain why a correction is needed. Keep going—you’re doing great!"""

To begin:
What are your plans for the weekend?

Now, let’s try something a little more advanced:
Use the **present continuous tense** to talk about something you have already arranged. (e.g., *I’m meeting my friend tomorrow*)

One more:
Use the phrase **“going to”** to describe your intentions. (e.g., *I’m going to visit my grandparents*)

Let me check your answers and give you helpful corrections if needed. Don’t hesitate to ask for help!"""
